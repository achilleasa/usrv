// Middleware is an interface implemented by objects that can be injected into
// a client's outgoing request flow.
//
// Pre is invoked before passing the request message to the transport. Calls to
// Pre may modify the outgoing request or the request context. In the latter case
// the updated context must be returned back from the call to Pre. If the call
// to Pre returns an error then the client will abort the request, execute
// Post hooks for middleware that has been already invoked and return the error
// back to the caller.
//
// Post is invoked after receiving a response from the remote endpoint.
//
// The client may opt to recycle the supplied request messages for handling future
// requests to reduce memory allocations. It is not valid to access the request
// message or modify the response message after or concurrently with the completion
// of the middleware handler.
